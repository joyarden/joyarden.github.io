                <br>
                <p>Iceland's unique location provides the country a magnificent landscape. Due to the mid-atlantic ridge and volcanic activity, Iceland benefits from hundreds of geothermal pools. Swimming in Iceland is one of the main activities that can be enjoyed year around because of the hot water temperatures. Within the tiny country of Iceland, there are over 120 public pools open year-around! In addition to public pools, there are hundreds of geothermal pools within the natural landscape.</p>

                <h1>Beaches</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The beaches in Iceland vary from coast to coast. Most beaches display black sand and occasional icebergs. While driving on the Ring Road, you can experience all types of different beaches. The cliffs and rock formations create unqiue coast lines that allow extraordinary views.

                <h1>Other</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The Iceland landscape is unlike any other country because of its location. Often, people describe the landscape as like being on the Moon or the planet Mars. The country has almost zero trees and is mostly covered in glaciers. Iceland is the only country that runs through the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. People can view and walk on the mid-atlantic ridge. Futhermore, in some locations, snorkling between plates provides a rare experience. Volcanos and glaciers create interesting geological attractions that are worth travelling to see. Some include geysers, craters, rock formations, caves, and icebergs! </p>
